# About

This is a GravityForms AddOn that creates a feed between GravityForms and CiviCRM. Currently this AddOn only allows for creating/editing Contact records along with assigning Dedupe rules for the Contact creation and also assigning Groups to the Contact.

The AddOn also allows the addition of multiple emails, phone numbers, and addresses like CiviCRM by taking advantage of the GravityForms [Repeater](https://docs.gravityforms.com/repeater-fields/) field. While this field cannot be set through the UI, you can add the fields to a form through a JSON file and either import the form as a new form, or use the [GravityForms CLI](https://www.gravityforms.com/add-ons/cli-add-on/) to update an existing form.
