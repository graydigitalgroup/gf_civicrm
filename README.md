# Setup

This is a GravityForms Add-On for CiviCRM that allows for populating forms and submitting form data to CiviCRM.

Current functionality
- adding/updating an individual or organization
- creating a relationship between an individual and organization
- adding a group(s) to the contact upon submission
- using the dedupe rules in CiviCRM within the form to prevent a duplicate
- Allows for multiple addresses, emails, and phone numbers using the GF repeater (Individual only)

Items to work on:
- Currently it only allows one Website record, look to move to allowing multiples with a GF repeater
- Add ability for creating contributions with line items
- Allow for multiple addresses, emails and phone numbers for Org contact types (or other contact types)
- Add more logic for handling other contact types
